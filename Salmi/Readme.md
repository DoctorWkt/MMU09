This is a highly modified version of the 6809 simulator written by Arto Salmi,
available at https://github.com/relrod/salmi

Status: I've started the work to add the page table to
the simulator. It's enough to run a simple monitor,
but it still needs a full workout. I also need to add
the generation of the NMI to the simulator.
