Here are the config and target files for the vbcc compiler.
You will need to download and install `vbcc`, `vasm` and `vlink`.

Edit the `config/mmu09` and change the location of
`MMU09/Library/include` to be where you have this Git
repository.

Now copy the contents of `config` and `targets` to
where you installed `vbcc`.
